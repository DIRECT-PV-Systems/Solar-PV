# Cost Analysis Directory

This directory utilizes the datasets from Berkeley Lab's *Tracking the Sun* project for cost analysis. These datasets contain data of various features of over 2,000,000,000 solar PV projects in the U.S.

The datasets were combined into one for ease of analysis. The TotalModuleQty.ipynb file walks through the process of calculating the total number of PV modules, which was necessary when discussing the total installation cost. 

The cost_function.py file and the corresponding Jupyter Notebook (CostAnalysis.ipynb) guide the users on utilizing feature selection to create more accurate machine learning regression modules.  

CostUpdated and Functions are Jupyter Notebooks that show the analysis with the complete dataset.
