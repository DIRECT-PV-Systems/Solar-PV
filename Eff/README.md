### Explanation of Efficiency Notebook

These files run through basic visualizations and Machine Learning techniques to compare efficiency values of Solar Panel Modules with other
relevant factors from the main dataset. 

Some of the ML techniques used are Linear and Decision Tree Regression. A Neural Net is also used to provide some more meaningful analysis and show how much loss is occuring from the testing set.

Please use the Efficiency_Analysis .ipynb, along with the corresponding py files: Eff_Functions.py and Tests_Efficiency.py, to see the final results.
