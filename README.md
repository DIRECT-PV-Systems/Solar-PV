# Solar-PV
Software Package for visualizing and analyzing efficiency of solar panel modules based on location, efficiency, cost and module tech.



Analysis of efficiency with nameplate capacity to give clients an idea of the numerical and statistical correlations. There is first some simple scatter plots to show a basic visualization, and then a regression model fitted. Additional plots are included showing how other factors are uncorrelated. Then a Decision Tree and Simple Neural Network to give some more robust ML analysis.
